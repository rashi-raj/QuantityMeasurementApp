  - Cross-unit conversions with proper precision
  - Immutability and value-object semantics
  - Input validation for null, NaN, and infinite values
  - Overloaded conversion methods for flexibility

### 📅 UC6: Addition of Two Length Units (Same Category)

- Enables addition of two lengths in the same measurement category (length), returning the result in the unit of the first operand. Supports same-unit and cross-unit additions with automatic conversion and preserves immutability.
- Key Concepts
  - Same-unit and cross-unit addition
  - Conversion to target unit (first operand)
  - Validation for nulls, zero, negative, NaN, and infinite values
  - Commutativity: add(A, B) = add(B, A)
  - Floating-point precision handling

Example:
  - Input: 1.0 ft + 2.0 ft → Output: 3.0 ft
  - Input: 1.0 ft + 12.0 in → Output: 2.0 ft
  - Input: 12.0 in + 1.0 ft → Output: 24.0 in
  - Input: 1.0 yd + 3.0 ft → Output: 2.0 yd
  - Input: 2.54 cm + 1.0 in → Output: ~5.08 cm

### 📅 UC7: Addition with Target Unit Specification

- Supports addition of two lengths with the ability to explicitly specify the target unit for the result. Extends UC6 by allowing flexibility in choosing the result unit instead of defaulting to the first operand’s unit. Ensures accurate conversions, commutativity, and immutability.
- Key Concepts
  - Addition of lengths with explicit target unit
  - Cross-unit conversion to any supported length unit
  - Validation for nulls, zero, negative, NaN, and infinite values
  - Commutativity maintained regardless of target unit
  - Floating-point precision handling across units

Example:
  - Input: 1.0 ft + 12.0 in → Target Unit: FEET → Output: 2.0 ft
  - Input: 1.0 ft + 12.0 in → Target Unit: INCHES → Output: 24.0 in
  - Input: 1.0 ft + 12.0 in → Target Unit: YARDS → Output: ~0.667 yd
  - Input: 1.0 yd + 3.0 ft → Target Unit: YARDS → Output: 2.0 yd
  - Input: 36.0 in + 1.0 yd → Target Unit: FEET → Output: 6.0 ft

### 📅 UC8: Refactoring Unit Enum to Standalone with Conversion Responsibility

- Refactors the design by extracting LengthUnit from QuantityLength into a standalone enum that handles all unit conversions. This improves cohesion, reduces coupling, eliminates circular dependencies, and establishes a scalable pattern for future measurement categories (weight, volume, etc.).
- Key Concepts
  - Standalone LengthUnit enum with conversion responsibility
  - QuantityLength simplified: focuses on equality and arithmetic
  - Conversion methods: convertToBaseUnit() and convertFromBaseUnit()
  - Backward compatible: all UC1–UC7 operations continue to work
  - Supports future measurement categories using the same pattern
  - Maintains immutability, type safety, and thread-safety

Example:
  - Input: Quantity(1.0, FEET).convertTo(INCHES) → Output: Quantity(12.0, INCHES)
  - Input: Quantity(1.0, FEET).add(Quantity(12.0, INCHES), FEET) → Output: Quantity(2.0, FEET)
  - Input: Quantity(36.0, INCHES).equals(Quantity(1.0, YARDS)) → Output: true
  - Input: Quantity(2.54, CENTIMETERS).convertTo(INCHES) → Output: Quantity(~1.0, INCHES)
  - Input: LengthUnit.INCHES.convertToBaseUnit(12.0) → Output: 1.0 (feet)

### 📅 UC9: Weight Measurement Equality, Conversion, and Addition

- Description: UC9 extends the Quantity Measurement App to support weight measurements (kilogram, gram, pound) alongside length. Weight operations mirror length operations: equality, conversion, and addition. Weight and length are separate, type-safe categories.

- Units & Conversion:
  - KILOGRAM (kg) – base unit
  - GRAM (g) – 1 kg = 1000 g
  - POUND (lb) – 1 lb ≈ 0.453592 kg

- Implementation:
  - WeightUnit enum handles all conversion logic.
  - QuantityWeight class handles equality and arithmetic, delegating conversions to WeightUnit.
  - Supports cross-unit equality and addition, explicit target unit, and immutable objects.
  - Round-trip conversions maintain precision using epsilon.
  - Weight vs. length comparisons are not allowed.

- Example:
  - Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).equals(Quantity(1000.0, GRAM)) → true
  - Quantity(2.20462, POUND).convertTo(KILOGRAM) → Quantity(~1.0, KILOGRAM)
  - Quantity(1.0, KILOGRAM).add(Quantity(1000.0, GRAM), GRAM) → Quantity(2000.0, GRAM)
